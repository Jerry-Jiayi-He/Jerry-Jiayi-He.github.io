His research interests lie in FinTech (such as Web3) and financial risk management, with a particular focus on the payment field. He is also broadly interested in how emerging technologies empower business and finance development and create social impact.\nPrior to his master’s studies, Jiayi obtained his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Traffic Engineering (Intelligent Transportation) from the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, ranking 2nd out of 58 in his cohort. His undergraduate thesis focused on slot sharing and service competition strategies for liner shipping companies under demand uncertainty, applying game-theoretic modeling to maritime supply chain coordination problems.\nHe has research experience spanning game theory, operations research, and deep learning, with publications in SCI-indexed journals. His competition awards include the First Prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematics Competition (Guangdong Province), First Prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Competition (Guangdong Province), and the Second Prize in the National Undergraduate Transport Science and Technology Competition (National Level).\nBeyond academia, Jiayi interned in the Department of Data Analysis and Algorithm at Ruqi Mobility, where he worked on operational performance prediction, flow filtering mechanisms based on marginal revenue analysis, and reinforcement learning models for order dispatching, enhancing platform resource allocation efficiency and driver income.\nJiayi is passionate about observing economic, finance and business phenomena in daily life and is enthusiastic about applying new technologies such as AI and blockchain to practical business and financial problems.\n\n\n\nSep 2024 - Present: MSc student in Management Science and Engineering, School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University\nSep 2020 - Jun 2024: BEng in Traffic Engineering (Intelligent Transportation), School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University\nGPA: 4.1/5 (Ranked 2/58), National Scholarship (2021), Outstanding Graduate (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Thesis (2024): Slot Sharing and Service Competition Strategies for Liner Shipping Companies under Demand Uncertainty\n\nConstructed game-theoretic models for a two-tier maritime supply chain with multiple sharing mechanisms, deriving managerial insights for operational optimization.\n\nUndergraduate Research Project (2021-2022): Multi-objective Optimization of Signalized Intersections under Mixed Traffic Flow\n\nLed a university-funded project applying operations research to real-world traffic environments in Shenzhen.\n\nSCI Publication (Third author, 2023): Sequence-based Local–Global Information Fusion Framework for Vertebrae Detection\n\nPublished in Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (SCI Zone II).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming & Data Analysis: Python, MATLAB, SQL, C\n\nMethodology: Game-theoretic modeling, Operations research (Optimization), Deep learning\nDocumentation: LaTeX, Microsoft Office\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-distance running, tennis, hiking\n\nCity exploration in the Greater Bay Area\n\nObserving and analyzing economic, technological, and business trends"
