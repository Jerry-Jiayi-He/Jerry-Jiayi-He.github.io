Jiayi He is a master student in Management Science and Engineering at the School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University. His research interests lie in **FinTech (such as Web3)** and **financial risk management**, with a particular focus on the payment field. He is also broadly interested in how emerging technologies empower business and finance development and create social impact.

Prior to his master's studies, Jiayi obtained his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Traffic Engineering (Intelligent Transportation) from the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, ranking **2nd out of 58** in his cohort. His undergraduate thesis focused on **slot sharing and service competition strategies for liner shipping companies under demand uncertainty**, applying game-theoretic modeling to maritime supply chain coordination problems.

He has research experience spanning **game theory, operations research, and deep learning**, with publications in SCI-indexed journals. His competition awards include the **First Prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematics Competition (Guangdong Province)**, **First Prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Competition (Guangdong Province)**, and the **Second Prize in the National Undergraduate Transport Science and Technology Competition (National Level)**.

Beyond academia, Jiayi interned in the Department of Data Analysis and Algorithm at **Ruqi Mobility**, where he worked on operational performance prediction, flow filtering mechanisms based on marginal revenue analysis, and reinforcement learning models for order dispatching, enhancing platform resource allocation efficiency and driver income.

Jiayi is passionate about observing economic, finance and business phenomena in daily life and is enthusiastic about applying new technologies such as **AI and blockchain** to practical business and financial problems.
